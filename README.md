A dataset that shows the history of the Olympics from 1896 till 2016 throughout different seasons, the cities who hosted it, having information about the teams, team players who played in it, the sports / events that were played, and the medals obtained by the players. 


Our goal is to visualize this dataset in order to understand it more and handle missing values. Integrate some tables together to gain new information, do some feature engineering and handle outliers.

Steps: 
First, we started by exploring the dataset we have. 

Then, we started collecting different research questions that will be answered by different visualization techniques throughout the project. 

After that, we cleaned the dataset by handling the null, duplicate, and missing values. 
We then integrated the data with 2 tables.Then, we created a new feature which is the bmi of each athlete. We also discretized ages and heights into different groups. 
Then, we handled outliers and did new graphs to see the effect of both handling outliers and the new features on our data and gain new info.

At the end, we plotted our graphs. 

Data exploration questions: 
1.	Who participated the most in the Olympics? 
2.	Who participates the most in each sport?
3.	What is the average age of each sport?
